Echo back can be simplified like this in Brainfuck.

I've never seen such a really short echo back program before. Definitely, Brainfuck was born to do that. :)

## Install Brainfuck

e.g. From Debian package

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install bf
```

## Usage

```sh
$ bf echo.bf
```

and then, make sure you'll type something.
